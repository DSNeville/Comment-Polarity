# Comment-Polarity

I am always reading through Youtube comments for videos that get the blood flowing on one matter or another.  
The objective of this project is to shed some light onto how polar comments are for a certain topic.  
Is the same topic, posted on another channel generating more neutral feedback?

I want to identify the subjects within the comments, and compare subjects across multiple videos.
